# KudosCrew â€” KudosPrime-like Cars Page Prototype

This is a small Next.js prototype that reproduces the KudosPrime-like cars listing page for The Crew Motorfest. It uses static JSON (`/data/cars.json`) and simple CSS to mimic the layout in your screenshot.

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deploy on Vercel by pushing to GitHub and connecting the repository.
